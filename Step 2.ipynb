#Objective 3
#Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP)
# 1. Statistical Aims
# The overarching aim of this study is to investigate potential associations between BMI (BMXBMI)
# and menstrual regularity (RHQ031) among adult women. The study seeks to answer the following research questions:
# Is BMI associated with menstrual regularity?
# Do women with irregular periods have higher or lower BMI compared to women with regular periods?
# How is BMI distributed across the population of adult women in the dataset?
# Are there outliers or skewness in BMI that need to be accounted for?
# Do BMI categories (underweight, normal, overweight, obese) differ in the proportion of women reporting regular vs.
# irregular menstrual cycles?
#
# 2. Sequence of Statistical Analyses
# 2.1 Data Exploration and Cleaning
# Inspect the dataset for missing or implausible values:
# BMXBMI: check for missing values and values outside a plausible range (10–70 kg/m²).
# RHQ031: recode as 1 = Yes (regular), 0 = No (irregular), and treat Refused, Don’t know, and missing as NaN.
#
# Examine distributions using descriptive statistics:
# BMXBMI: mean, SD, median, IQR, min, max
# RHQ031: counts and percentages for each category
#
# Python functions/packages:
# pandas.describe(), pandas.value_counts(), numpy.isnull(), matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn
#
# 2.2 Univariate Analyses
# Continuous variable (BMI):
# Histogram, density plot, and boxplot to explore distribution and identify outliers.
#
# Categorical variable (RHQ031):
# Frequency table with counts and percentages.
#
#  2.3 Bivariate Analyses
#  Comparison of BMI by menstrual regularity (Yes vs. No):
# Two-sample independent t-test if BMI is normally distributed.
#
# Python functions/packages:
# scipy.stats.ttest_ind(),
#
# Logistic Regression:
# Outcome: menstrual regularity (RHQ031_clean)
# Predictor: BMI (continuous)
#
# Optional covariates: age, smoking, other demographic variables
#
# Estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals
#
# Secondary Analysis: BMI categories vs. menstrual regularity
# Create categorical BMI variable: Underweight (<18.5), Normal (18.5–24.9), Overweight (25–29.9), Obese (≥30)
# Cross-tabulate BMI category with menstrual regularity
# Chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test if expected counts <5
#
# 3. Graphical Analyses (Objective Four)
# Two or more insightful graphs will be generated:
# Boxplot of BMI by menstrual regularity
# X-axis: menstrual regularity (Yes vs No)
# Y-axis: BMI
#
# scatterplot
# BMI vs. probability of regular periods using logistic regression predictions
#
# 4. Tables and Summary Outputs
# Table 1: Descriptive statistics of BMI (mean ± SD, median, IQR) overall and by menstrual regularity
# Table 2: Counts and percentages for RHQ031 responses overall and by BMI category
# Table 3: Logistic regression results (OR, 95% CI, p-values)
# Graphical Figures: Boxplot, scatterplot
#
# 5. Software and Packages
# Python packages: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scipy, statsmodels
#
# 6. Missing Data Handling
# Exclude participants with missing BMI or RHQ031 for primary analyses
# Report the number and proportion of excluded participants
